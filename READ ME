SWEN 303 Mini-Project

I have submitted a Colenso.mp4 which is a recording of a tour of my website. I have used a microphone that was a little quiet and I apologise for this I am sorry. 

I have also submitted a zip file Asssignment_1.zip. This contains all the code that was used in the website at the time of the recording. It also has the database included and all the node packages. This should work out of the box on the lab computers at Victoria University.

My github page is https://github.com/GarethTucker/swen303_mini_project where you can see the progress of the website over time and pull it down. If you do this you will need to install the node packages with npm install. 

I have completed the three scenarios in core:
1. searches based on Strings and logical operators
2. Searches based on XQuery queries
3. Browse the xmls in human readable format and being able to download it. I also have the URL linked to the document but this was not shown in the video I am sorry.

I have completed the three scenarios in completion
1. Adding an XML document to the website
2. Nested searching on the text search.
3. Editing the xml on the website.

I have also completed one of the challenges 
1. I have a user that would like to delete one of the xmls from the database. I have added a delete button for them.

Please note that I have used the image/logo from the Colenso website.
