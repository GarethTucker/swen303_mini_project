I have completed the three scenarios in core:
1. searches based on Strings and logical operators
2. Searches based on XQuery queries
3. Browse the xmls in human readable format and being able to download it. I also have the URL linked to the document but this was not shown in the video I am sorry.

I have completed the three scenarios in completion
1. Adding an XML document to the website
2. Nested searching on the text search.
3. Editing the xml on the website.

I have also completed one of the challenges 
1. I have a user that would like to delete one of the xmls from the database. I have added a delete button for them.

Please note that I have used the image/logo from the Colenso website.
